____
Are you hosting a **coworking space**, a **hot-desk office** or a community space like a **hacker space**?

Desks are a limited resource.
Your members will be disappointed when they arrive at your location and realize there aren't any desks available.
Sometimes there are desks available, but a user has some special requirement like a power outlet or the user just wants to sit close to a window.

In these cases you probably want to set up a desk-booking solution like __Mensam__.
____

== Usage

=== Setup

As the operator you simply visit an instance of Mensam, such as https://mens.am[mens.am].

First you will have to create a __User__ account for yourself.
Now you create a new __Space__ for your location.
Within this __Space__ you can now add __Desks__.

=== Join a Space

After creating a __User__ account you can simply join a __Space__ with a single click.
Depending on the setup of the __Space__, it is listed publically or only accessible with a specific link.

=== Book a desk

After joining a __Space__ you can create a __Reservation__ for a __Desk__.
You will be able to see other __Reservations__, so you can plan around them.
Mensam will deny overlapping reservations.

== Deployment

=== Docker

You can host a server using Docker.
Docker Images are available on https://hub.docker.com/r/jumper149/mensam[DockerHub].

[IMPORTANT]
====
Make sure you are pulling an up-to-date version.

Set up the configuration file. Use link:./final/configurations/docker.json[`docker.json`] as a template configuration.
====


[source,bash]
----
docker pull jumper149/mensam:v0.10.0.2
docker run --publish 8080:8177 --volume ./final/configurations/docker.json:/etc/mensam/mensam.json jumper149/mensam:v0.10.0.2
----

This will use the default configuration file for Docker deployments and now you should be able to visit the web interface on http://localhost:8080.

=== NixOS module

You can host a server by enabling it in your NixOS configuration.

[source,nix]
----
{ config, pkgs, lib, ... }:
{
  services.mensam = {
    enable = true;
    config = {
      port = 8177;
      email-config = {
        hostname = "my-hostname.com";
        username = "mensam@my-hostname.com";
        password = "********";
      };
      base-url = {
        scheme = "https";
        authority = {
          host = "mensam.my-hostname.com";
          port= null;
        };
        path = [];
      };
    };
    environment = {
    };
  };

  services.nginx.enable = true;
  services.nginx.recommendedGzipSettings = true;
  services.nginx.virtualHosts."mensam.my-hostname.com" = {
    forceSSL = true;
    locations."/".proxyPass = "http://127.0.0.1:${toString config.services.mensam.config.port}";
    locations."/".extraConfig = ''
      add_header Cache-Control "no-store";
    '';
    extraConfig = ''
      error_page 501 502 503 /fallback.html;
      location = /fallback.html {
        root ${pkgs.mensam.full.fallback.outPath};
        add_header Cache-Control "no-store";
      }
    '';
  };
}
----

== Development

Mensam is built with Nix.
You can use regular flake commands such as `nix build`, `nix develop` or `nix flake check`.

=== Subflakes

The source code is split up into subflakes, which also have their own development environments and checks.
These are just regular nix files, but follow the naming conventions of flakes.

link:./server[Server]:: HTTP API, Server executable, CLI-client executable
link:./frontend[Frontend]:: Single page web application
link:./static[Static]:: Static files served by the server

=== GitHub Codespaces

You can use a GitHub Codespace to quickly spin up a development environment in your browser.

A prebuilt devcontainer image is available for the `main` branch.
This devcontainer includes a cached nix-shell.
You can use the VSCode direnv extension to reload the nix-shell.

* The direnv extension might require a restart to actually work.
* The Haskell and Elm extensions might ask for a compiler or language server executable. Stick to the defaults. If anything seems to be missing in the environment, just reload the direnv extension.
* The Haskell language server in particular takes quite a bit of time to start.

=== Binary Cache

GitHub Actions pushes Nix results to Cachix.
Use this binary cache to speed up your local builds.

Configure your NixOS configuration to trust the binary cache.

[source,nix]
----
{
  nix.settings = {
    substituters = [
      "https://jumper149-mensam.cachix.org"
    ];
    trusted-public-keys = [
      "jumper149-mensam.cachix.org-1:9502wAOm00GdLxZM8uTE4goaBGCpHb+d1jUt3dhR8ZM="
    ];
  };
}
----

=== Versioning

Any version number `EPOCH.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` already tells the operator of a deployment some basic information.

`EPOCH`:: Enormous changes. Read the link:./CHANGELOG.adoc[changelog]!
`MAJOR`:: Major changes. These changes break backwards compatibility, often including database migrations.
`MINOR`:: Minor changes. These changes are backwards compatible. API changes are also considered __minor__ as the frontend is contained within the application.
`PATCH`:: Bugfixes. These changes should always be applied as soon as possible.

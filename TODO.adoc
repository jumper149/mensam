= TODO

* Continuous integration.
  ** [ ] Run weeder as part of `nix flake check`.
  ** [ ] Run elm-review as part of `nix flake check`.
    *** https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/issues/157
  ** [ ] Use `nixosConfigurations` to test the `nixosModule`.

* [ ] Email backend.
  ** [x] Implement `EmailT` with an instance `MonadEmail`.
  ** [x] Send a mail on registration.
    *** [ ] The registration mail may include a link to confirm the user's email.
      **** The registration should still be considered complete, even when the confirmation didn't happen yet. User's don't want to look into their mails before booking a desk.
      **** [x] Database column in user table to track email confirmation.
      **** [x] New backend route to handle this confirmation
      **** [ ] Frontend (URL, screen, API, ...) should be able to handle this confirmation link.
  ** [ ] Make emails look good instead of sending just plain text.

* Frontend.
  ** [ ] Add loading screen to HTML wrapper for frontend.
  ** [ ] Add wrapper function that sets ALL font properties at once, so you cannot forget anything.
  ** [ ] Add link to source code somewhere on the landing page. Maybe in a footer?

* [ ] Database migrations.
  ** [x] Database initialization is automatically handled during startup.
  ** [ ] Database migration is automatically handled during startup.
  ** My current idea:
    *** A new table (maybe in a separate schema) to track the database version.
    *** Every mensam release will be associated with a database version.
    *** During startup, check whether the database version is up-to-date.
    *** If not, then automatically run the migration and finally bump the database version.

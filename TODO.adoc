= TODO

* Continuous integration.
  ** [ ] Run elm-review as part of `nix flake check`.
    *** https://github.com/jfmengels/elm-review/issues/157
  ** [ ] Use `nixosConfigurations` to test the `nixosModule`.

* Developer Experience.
  ** [ ] Support Nix flakes with in GitHub Codespaces.
    *** [ ] `direnv` from https://github.com/xtruder/nix-devcontainer is outdated.

* Backend.
  ** [ ] Send email on successful reservations.
  ** [ ] `/space/view` route should return 404 when there is no such space.
  ** [ ] File uploads.
    *** [ ] Profile pictures.
    *** [ ] Space pictures.
    *** [ ] Desk pictures.
  ** [ ] Simplify names.
    ** [ ] -> Change `SpaceRole` to `Role`
    ** [ ] -> Change `SpaceRolePermission` to `Permission`
  ** [ ] Space visibility should be hidden by default.

* Frontend.
  ** [ ] Terms and Conditions check during registration.
  ** [ ] Add loading screen to HTML wrapper for frontend.
    *** This is harder than expected. Is it possible to start Elm from JS directly?
  ** [ ] Add wrapper function that sets ALL font properties at once, so you cannot forget anything.
  ** [ ] Handle confirmation links.
  ** [ ] Add QR code generator for URLs to join space.
  ** [ ] Light/Dark mode.
  ** [ ] Factor out duplicate code (buttons, styling and so on).
    *** [x] Buttons
  ** [ ] Automatically sign in after sign up.
    *** Currently this doesn't work with setting the URL and reloading that URL again.
  ** [ ] Create space on dashboard.
    *** When there are no space memberships there should be a big button to create a new space.
  ** [ ] Automatically add desks when creating a space.
    *** This could be achieved with a selector of how many desks you want and then adding default desks.
  ** [ ] Unified button to "Go back". Top left instead of "Mensam" text?
  ** [ ] Title in header will cut off titles that are too long. This looks broken. Maybe add "...".
  ** [ ] Error messages are shitty. These should popup immediately to tell the user something is wrong.
    *** Maybe we want non-error popups as well.
  ** [ ] Filter "Your Reservations".
    *** [ ] Filter by space.
  ** [ ] Show more info for spaces in "Your Dashboard" and "Browse Spaces"
    *** [ ] City.
    *** more?
  ** [ ] When editing (for example "Name") insert current value into the text input field.
    *** [ ] For Spaces.
    *** [ ] For Desks.
    *** [x] For Roles.
  ** Creating reservations.
    *** [ ] Describe "from" and "to" when creating reservation.
    *** [ ] Improve SVG time picker.
      **** [ ] Add text based time.
      **** [ ] Don't select seconds. Just `hh:mm`.
      **** [ ] Automatically set upper/lower bound when entering negative time interval.
      **** [ ] Grey out "Submit" button when the entered time span is already booked/not possible.
      **** [ ] Better default time when opening the dialog to create a reservation.

* Wording and explanation.
  ** [ ] A space is just an environment for desks and not the desk itself.
  ** [ ] Visibility: hidden and visible or private and public?
  ** [ ] Roles and permissions are complicated. This needs some better description, tooltips (info icon) and interface.

* Pin timezone libraries.
  ** [ ] tzdata library for Haskell.
  ** [ ] justinmimbs/timezone-data for Elm.
  ** [ ] Matching IANA database versions.

* Google calendar integration.

* Microsoft Outlook calender integration.

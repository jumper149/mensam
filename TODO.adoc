  ** [ ] SQLite Database

* [ ] Run weeder as part of `nix flake check`.

* [ ] Email backend.
  ** [ ] Implement `EmailT` with an instance `MonadEmail`.
  ** [ ] Send a mail on registration.
    *** [ ] The registration mail may include a link to confirm the user's email.
      **** The registration should still be considered complete, even when the confirmation didn't happen yet. User's don't want to look into their mails before booking a desk.
      **** [ ] Database column in user table to track email confirmation.
      **** [ ] New backend route to handle this confirmation
      **** [ ] Frontend (URL, screen, API, ...) should be able to handle this confirmation link.

= TODO

* Continuous integration.
  ** [ ] Use `nixosConfigurations` to test the `nixosModule`.

* Developer Experience.
  ** [ ] Support Nix flakes with in GitHub Codespaces.
    *** [ ] `direnv` from https://github.com/xtruder/nix-devcontainer is outdated.

* Backend.
  ** [ ] File uploads.
    *** [x] Profile pictures.
    *** [x] Space pictures.
    *** [ ] Desk pictures.
  ** [ ] Forbid creating reservations in the past. Maybe this should be configurable for each space (or role?).

* Frontend.
  ** [ ] Improve Dashboard UI.
  ** [ ] Improve user settings UI.
  ** [ ] Improve look of user preview for users without `edit-user` permission.
  ** [ ] Add loading screen to HTML wrapper for frontend.
    *** This is harder than expected. Is it possible to start Elm from JS directly?
  ** [ ] Add wrapper function that sets ALL font properties at once, so you cannot forget anything.
  ** [ ] Light/Dark mode.
  ** [ ] Factor out duplicate code (buttons, styling and so on).
  ** [ ] Automatically add desks when creating a space.
    *** This could be achieved with a selector of how many desks you want and then adding default desks.
  ** [ ] Title in header will cut off titles that are too long. This looks broken. Maybe add ellipsis "...".
  ** [ ] Filter "Your Reservations".
    *** [ ] Filter by space.
  ** [ ] Add metadata to spaces.
    *** [ ] City.
    *** more?
  ** [ ] Add metadata to desks.
    *** [ ] Power outlet.
    *** [ ] Monitor.
    *** [ ] Window.
    *** more?

* Wording and explanation.
  ** [ ] A space is just an environment for desks and not the desk itself.
  ** [ ] Visibility: hidden and visible or private and public?
  ** [ ] Roles and permissions are complicated. This needs some better description, tooltips (info icon) and interface.

* Pin timezone libraries.
  ** [ ] tzdata library for Haskell.
  ** [ ] justinmimbs/timezone-data for Elm.
  ** [ ] Matching IANA database versions.

* Rooms.
  ** [ ] Desks can be assigned to rooms.
    *** Desk location will always refer to the assigned room.
    *** Can desks have a location without a room? Probably not.
  ** [ ] Whole rooms can be booked.
    *** [ ] Rooms can only be booked when no desk in the room is already booked.
    *** [ ] Booked rooms block all desks inside that room.
  ** [ ] Rooms are displayed nicely in the 2D room view.
  ** [ ] Rooms can be edited independently of desks.
  ** [ ] Add editor for room layout.

* Smart desk assignment.
  ** Users can choose to reserve any desk (not a specific one).
  ** Mensam will not choose the desk until the reservation actually happens.
  ** That way other people with preferences can still choose whatever they want.

* Google calendar integration.

* Microsoft Outlook calender integration.

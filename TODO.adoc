  ** [ ] Database migration is automatically handled during startup.
  ** My current idea:
    *** A new table (maybe in a separate schema) to track the database version.

    *** If not, then automatically run the migration and finally bump the database version.

* Pin timezone libraries.
  ** [ ] tzdata library for Haskell.
  ** [ ] justinmimbs/timezone-data for Elm.
  ** [ ] Matching IANA database versions.

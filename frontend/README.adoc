= Frontend

The web frontend is written in Elm.

== Development

=== Formatting

Use `elm-format` to format Elm.

[source,bash]
----
# Format Elm.
elm-format --yes src
----

=== Linting

Use `elm-review` to lint Elm.
Unfortunately this doesn't work well with Nix, so this has to be called manually.

[source,bash]
----
# Review Elm.
elm-review
----

=== Nix

Elm dependencies are pinned in link:./elm-srcs.nix[elm-srcs.nix].
The files link:./registry.dat[registry.dat] and link:./versions.dat[versions.dat] are also required to build the frontend with Nix.

[source,bash]
----
# Update `elm-srcs.nix`.
elm2nix convert > elm-srcs.nix

# Update `registry.dat` and `versions.dat`.
elm2nix snapshot

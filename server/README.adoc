= Server

The server executable is written in Haskell using wai and servant for the HTTP interface.
OpenAPI documentation is generated automatically.
This application uses mtl-style effects.
An SQLite database is used for persistent storage.

== Configuration

Environment variables and a configuration file change the runtime behaviour.

=== Environment

Environment variables are checked early during the initialization.
The options are set link:./source/library/Mensam/Server/Environment.hs[here].

=== Configuration file

The configuration file is written in JSON and is specified in link:./source/library/Mensam/Server/Configuration.hs[here].

== Database

The filepath for the SQLite database can be configured.
The database will be automatically initialized during the first startup.
Database migrations will be automatically applied when you run a new version of the server application.

WARNING: Downgrades are not supported.

== Development

[source,bash]
----
# Generate static files and configuration.
nix build ..#subflakes.final.packages.x86_64-linux.config

# Use cabal to develop the application.
MENSAM_CONFIG_FILE=result cabal run mensam-server -O0
----

=== Formatting

Use `fourmolu` to format Haskell.

[source,bash]
----
# Format Haskell.
fourmolu --mode inplace ./source
----

=== `weeder`

Running `weeder` should be a part of linting, but requires manual execution at the moment.

[source,bash]
----
# Prepare additional information for weeder.
cabal clean
cabal build all

# Run weeder.
weeder
----

=== `graphmod`

The module dependency graph can be visualised using `graphmod`.

[source,bash]
----
# Run graphmod.
nix build ..#subflakes.server.checks.x86_64-linux.graphmod

# View graph with xdot or your PDF viewer.
xdot result/graphmod.dot
zathura result/graphmod.pdf
